# Project Title and Description:

# Comparing binary classifiers for stroke prediction
## We took stroke data, cleaned it, stratified it and ran it through 2 traditional machine learning processes -- Nearest Neighbors and random forest. We built a Neural network and tried tuning it in various ways for best accuracy.

# Installation
## These libraries must all be installed on your system to run our code: warnings, pandas, pathlib, sklearn.model_selection, sklearn.metrics, sklearn.preprocessing, Matplotlib, Tensor flow.

# Usage
## In order to use the project clone the repository to your computer. After that go to Google Drive and Open Colab. 
## To run the machine learning models Upload the notebook called colab_models to Colab. Add the full_data.csv to the Colab files area and run the code.
## To run the visualizations code upload the notebook called Visualizations (Matplot Lib).ipynb. Add the full_data.csv to the Colab files area and run the code.

# Data 
## In repo folder you will find our data set -- full_data.csv

# Model Architecture
## We used 3 models based on random forests. First we pre processed the data in Pandas then scaled it. We used Tensor flow for the Neural Network and Keras tuner to fine tune the models. 

# Results
## Highest accuracy is the random forest classifier = 0.776

## K Nearest Neighbor accuracy = 0.767

## Neural Networks Accuracy = 0.767
